A friend of mine brought up the Game of Life in conversation and I started thinking about my own implementation based on Conway's original rules. I realised that I had actually encountered the GoL before, in my second year of university. However much of the code for that assignment was already provided, and it was all console based with a static starting colony. This version is graphical and multi-threaded but stays true to the original sim.\r\n\r\n# Feature List:\r\n* Exact replication of the original Game of Life devised by Conway in 1970\r\n* Visual representation of colony on a 2D-grid\r\n* Create/Destroy lifeforms at any time, even while the simulation is running\r\n* Several loadable templates\r\n\r\n# Changelog:\r\nv1.1\r\n\r\n-added several loadable templates\r\n\r\n-added the ability to change cell colour\r\n\r\n-added keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n-initial release\r\n","name":"Game-of-life"}
